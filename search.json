Unfortunately, starting a restaurant requires navigating a labyrinth of shifting regulations, government agencies that cannot communicate with each other, and much more. This project would benefit new restaurant owners, particularly those starting a restaurant with limited English proficiency, whether written or spoken.\n\n\nBuild a tool for advocates to calculate SNAP benefits for clients​\nGoal: Compare and contrast existing SNAP calculators to determine whether they can be customized to maximize their effectiveness or whether a new, more effective tool can be built to meet advocates’ needs.\nThousands of families in Philadelphia depend on assistance to access healthy food. Thousands more are eligible for assistance but do not receive it. Many advocacy organizations around the city try to help families access the benefits they are entitled to, but unfortunately calculating benefits is challenging and requires a great deal of expertise.\nSome advocates rely on spreadsheets to help their staff make the calculations, but maintaining a spreadsheet is challenging. It must be regularly updated and a new copy distributed. The spreadsheet does not capture background knowledge advocates need, and sometimes there are new rules for eligibility which the current spreadsheet does not have the ability to handle. Other advocates rely on existing web applications that are designed to calculate SNAP benefits but those tools often require customization, have undesirable terms of service, and ultimately fall short of meeting their needs."

Judge elections are low information and little information is available for voters to make choices. Criminal court judges have 10-year terms in Philadelphia County. Therefore, a decision to retain an elected judge has a long-term impact on our criminal justice system. So what can one do as a concerned citizen to become better informed? Thankfully, court docket data is public data.\nUsing pre-assembled, de-identified court docket data, this project built a dashboard to shed light on how judges are performing their jobs. This dashboard enables Philadelphia voters to make more informed choices about what judges to vote to retain on our courts.\nWhat did they do?\n\nThe project created the website raiseourbar.com (github repo here)\nPresentation on youtube (00:54:23)\n\n\n\nNow we are hearing about “Raising The Bar,” an interactive website to inform voters about elected judges in Philadelphia.

Lawyers are required to record time in 6 minute increments for each case they work on. Having to constantly log into the online system breaks their workflow.\nWhat they built\nDeveloped a voice activated system for tracking case time that uses a custom python voice extension for python using the Talon API.\nCustom voice commands are used to record timestamps for when work is started and stopped on a case.\n\nThe “start tracking [case]” command records the start time into a database.\nThe “stop tracking [case]” command records and end time, and writes the start and stop times into a time_records table.\nIf “start tracking” is done for a new case, the existing tracked cases will be ended and moved to the time_records table for future reporting.\n\nThe system allows Case numbers to be mapped to names for easier commanding. The next steps would be to build an add-on to log into the legal server website and send the reported time data.\nProject Links\n\nGitHub Repo\nSlides\nPresentation on youtube (00:25:47)\n\n\n\nThe third solution comes from Carl, who created a voice activated system for tracking case time.

There are organizations in Philadelphia that provide services to immigrant families, across a range of immigration statuses, languages, and neighborhoods. These organizations need a tool that compiles information about their services into one place and provides an interactive, intuitive, and linguistically accessible way to filter relevant resources for the individual seeking assistance.\nWhat they built\nThis tool guides newly arrived immigrants or service providers who support them through a simple series of questions and leads to a final report with relevant, accessible programs for the newly-arrived immigrant to contact. The tool is interactive and intuitive with translation through Google translate for immigrant community member use.\nThe solution was built using Neota, a no-code legal platform to store information about organizations and provide a listing of relevant organizations, based on user input.\nUser input is gathered through a questionnaire, and used by the program to generate the output efficiently and quickly, without storing user input and personal information.\nThe program uses a three-step validation system consisting of three decision trees to simultaneously validate the input information. In this process of validation, the program checks input information against the criteria in the decision trees to see if any organization in the database meets the requirements. It then generates a report of appropriate services.\nThe technical inspiration came from existing projects, such as a Neota-based project for legal services in South Carolina, and local Pennsylvania resources, such as Youth Matters Philly and Pasa La Voz.\nProject Links\n\nTry it: Georgetown.neotalogic.com\nView presentation on youtube (00:38:24)\n\n\n\nCONGRATS to the Social Justice Hackathon Philadelphia team that created an app that guides immigrants in Philly.
